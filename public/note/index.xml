      <description>[[fetch]] files = [&#34;./updatecode.py&#34;, &#34;./reunion.wav&#34;] Hey everyone,
My website now has support for Python code using PyScript! This means that, on top of formatting code for LaTeX formulas&amp;hellip;
sr1, sample1 = wavread(&#39;./reunion.wav&#39;) sample1 = sample1[:int(len(sample1)/4)] figure, axs = plt.subplots(1,2) figure.set_size_inches(18, 8) figure.suptitle(&amp;quot;Chopin Op.28 No. 1 \&amp;quot;Reunion\&amp;quot;&amp;quot;) axs[0].plot(sample1); axs[0].set_title(&amp;quot;Waveform&amp;quot;) a = spectrogram(axs[1], sample1, sr1) display(figure, target=&amp;quot;plot&amp;quot;) &amp;hellip;my website can now show implementations of formulas and display and plot code output! I hope to start using this feature for my future Audio Processing articles by directly implementing Python code into the page.</description>

      <description>üí° You can read the bolded sections of this post to get the TL;DR.
Hey everyone,
I&amp;rsquo;m proud to announce that my blog posts now have comments! You can use this section to leave feedback, continue topic discussions or suggest edits. I only ask that everyone be kind and courteous to each other, (please don&amp;rsquo;t force me to moderate negative/toxic comments or remove commenting entirely).
Additionally, I&amp;rsquo;ve replaced the previous &amp;ldquo;Articles&amp;rdquo; tab with &amp;ldquo;Audio Processing&amp;rdquo; as I&amp;rsquo;m starting to make audio processing tutorials.</description>

      <title>LaTeX for Note-Taking</title>

      <description>$\LaTeX$ LaTeX, pronounced &amp;ldquo;lah-tech&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;lay-tech&amp;rdquo;, is a typesetting system based on the TeX language. It was developed in 1985 by American computer scientist Leslie Lamport, who wrote the package due to his frequent use of shortcuts for mathematical and scientific symbols in his own writing. Since then, it has become a staple in the world of academia as one of the premier document-writing tools with numerous integrations and extensions to the LaTeX package.</description>

      <description>‚ö†Ô∏è This article assumes you have a decent understanding about console commands and Git.
Introduction I have something rather important to get off my chest:
I don&#39;t like web dev. There, I said it. I&#39;ve used plenty of tools in the past, including HTML, CSS and Javascript, yet the idea of making websites never truly stuck. To me, there was always an additional layer of complication that I could never get around.</description>
