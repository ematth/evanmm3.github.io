## $$\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n} (y_i - (mx_i + c))^2$$

<i>Welcome to my website!</i> As you can see, it's currently in the works, as there's practically nothing here.<br> That is expected to change soon.

All pages can be accessed from the menu at the top of the page. This is where you can access my [personal blog](/note/) where you can read my fun subjective posts on various topics. For more educational posts, check out [articles](/post/) where I hope to summarize topics related to music, programming, audio computing, and mathematics in an easily-digestible format.
