## $$\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n} (y_i - (mx_i + c))^2$$

<i>Welcome to my website!</i> As you can see, it's currently in the works, as there's practically nothing here.<br> That is expected to change soon.


<!-- ```bash

I can certainly further reduce the code, for example, by eliminating the CSS, but I believe a tiny bit of CSS can greatly improve readability. You cannot really find many CSS frameworks that only contain 50 lines of code.

Although it is a minimal theme, it is actually fully functional. It supports pages (including the home page), blog posts, a navigation menu, categories, tags, and RSS. With [a little bit customization](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin/blob/master/exampleSite/layouts/partials/foot_custom.html), it can easily support LaTeX math expressions, e.g.,

$$\alpha - \beta = \gamma$$ -->

All pages can be accessed from the menu at the top of the page. This is where you can access my [personal blog](/note/) where you can read my fun subjective posts on various topics. For more educational posts, check out [articles](/post/) where I hope to summarize topics related to music, programming, audio computing, and mathematics in an easily-digestible format.
