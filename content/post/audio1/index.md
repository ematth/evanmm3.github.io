# Waveform

We'll define all sounds imported and exported as **waveforms**, or arrays of integer or floating-point values that designate the amplitude of a sound for each *frame* of sound. A single frame of a waveform won't sound like much, (*or anything at all*), but when a number of frames are played sequentially, our ears can process the information.
